# TLDR

Write a short script with 1 speaker. The techniques we are going to learn can easily be extended to multiple speakers but let's keep it simple for now.

## Important logistics

For this journey, we want our script to be super short in the name of efficiency. A short script that is 5-10 seconds in duration is more than enough.

## Useful tools

- Your mind
- Your creativity
- Your experiences
- Claude
- ChatGPT

## Important caveats

Let your mind run free. Express your creativity.

## Example script

```txt
I'm like a bird. I'm soaring. I've never been so free. But I'm reminded of Icarus who flew too high. Always stay grounded.
```

## Example prompts for writing scripts if you're creatively challenged

### Example 1

```txt
Write a poem in 3 parts with each part of the poem taking between 4-8 seconds to recite.
```

### Example 2

```txt
Write a poem in 3 parts with each part of the poem taking between 4-8 seconds to recite. The poem should be about a bright eyed man about to fulfill his destiny.
```
