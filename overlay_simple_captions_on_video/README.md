# TLDR

This is a workflow I use all the time because I like posting short-form vertical video clips on Social Media. Due to this nature of the medium, having captions on short-form video emphasizes the spoken script and boosts engagement.

## How to use

- First, find a font you like
- Store the .ttf file of the font into some cloud storage provider, like Dropbox (as used in the workflow)
- Store the video whose captions will be generated into the same cloud storage provider
- Adjust the JSON2Video node in the workflow to point to your .ttf file and your video
- Run the workflow
