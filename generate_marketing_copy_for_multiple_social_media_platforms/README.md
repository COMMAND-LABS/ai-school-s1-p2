# TLDR

This is a workflow I use all the time because I like posting short-form vertical video clips on Social Media. What this workflow does is leverage an n8n AI agent to generate marketing copy that accompanies a chosen video clip for 6 different social media platforms: YouTube, LinkedIn, X.com, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.

## How to use

- You'll need to plug in an OpenAI API key to power the agent. Go over to the OpenAI platform linked below and purchase some credits. The minimum allowable purchase amount should be more than enough.
- You need to plug in an API key for Airtable, which you should be able to do for free.
