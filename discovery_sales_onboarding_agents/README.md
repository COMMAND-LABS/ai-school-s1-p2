# TLDR

This workflow was inspired by Roberto Luna. This workflow consists of a collection of agents that listen to your virtual meetings and automatically schedule sales, closing, and onboarding on your calendar.

## How to use

You'll need to configure your note taking application to dump transcripts into Google Drive. This workflow will get triggered when the transcript gets added to Google Drive and will have an agent process the transcript and automatically add tasks to an Airtable task list and to your Google Calendar.
