# TLDR

This workflow was copied from Nate Herk. This workflow consists of two parts: PART A allows you to ingest documents sitting in a Google Drive folder into a Pinecone database embedded using one of OpenAI's embedding models & PART B allows you to chat with an agent that has a tool for searching the chunks of data ingested into the Pinecone database.

## How to use

- You'll need to plug in an OpenAI API key to power the agent. Go over to the OpenAI platform linked below and purchase some credits. The minimum allowable purchase amount should be more than enough.
- You'll need to create an account on Pinecone and provision an API key (should be free)
- You'll need to have a Gmail account and a folder created in your Google Drive (the files in this folder is what will be chunked)
